\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will look at the idea of \emph{tutorial profiling} 
using operating-system-wide activity tracing. Porta is a prototype that 
instantiates this idea for macOS. Porta consists of an OS-wide activity 
recorder, a webpage navigation tracker, and interactive profiling 
visualizations.

This chapter will look at the system design, scope and evaluation of Porta.
