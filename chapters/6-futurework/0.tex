\chapter{Future work}
We built a modular OS monitoring and logging infrastructure on both the systems. As a result, we can easily incorporate additional OS level events on them. Future work for these systems could look at incorporating application level events into the logging system. An example of this is logging events on applications like Adobe Photoshop~\cite{Photoshop} so that we can extend our systems to generate and profile tutorials that involve Photoshop.

In terms of user studies, we are currently working on a second user study for the Porta system. We want to mathematically model the number of learners a tutorial would need to reach a reasonable level of polish.

Also, future work includes a more in-depth consumer study on Torta. We want to look at the effectiveness of tutorials created by Torta. This includes a comparative study of the knowledge gain in users who used tutorials created by Torta and whether it was on par or better than static tutorials or screencasts.
