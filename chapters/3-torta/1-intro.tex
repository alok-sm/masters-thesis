\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will look at generating mixed-media tutorials 
by combining screencast video recording with application-agnostic
operating-system-wide activity tracing. Torta is a prototype system 
that instantiates this approach for macOS. Torta consists of an 
operating-system-wide activity recorder, a tutorial editor, and a 
tutorial viewer that can validate step-by-step progress and even 
run certain steps.

This chapter will look at the formative study that inspired our design goals, the system design and it's evaluation.
