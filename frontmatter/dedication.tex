%% DEDICATION
% You have three choices here:
%   1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.   Put in the text you want,
%   and you'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%   2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%   formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%   however you wish.
%
%   3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

\begin{dedication} % The style file will format this for you.
  lol idk
\end{dedication}
