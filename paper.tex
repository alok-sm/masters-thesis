\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}
% documentclass options: default is 11pt, oneside, final.
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted by OGS
% mode: draft, final -- draft mode switches to single spacing, removes hyperlinks,
%                       and places a black box at every overfull hbox (check these before submission).
% chapterheads -- include this if you want your chapters to read:
% Chapter 1
% Title of Chapter
%
% instead of
%
% 1 Title of Chapter

% You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
% bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} within the text to create an entry in the index
% for keyword.

%% HYPERLINKS
% To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
% THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
% Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
% to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
% Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
% See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
% Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
